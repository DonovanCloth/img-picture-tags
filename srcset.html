    <h2>The img tag with a source AND a srcset attribute</h2>

    <p>
      In order to test it disable your cache and refresh the page below the
      following width values
    </p>

    <p>below 500px will trigger the cat-500 image</p>
    <p>below 1000px will trigger the cat-1000 image</p>
    <p>below 1500px will trigger the cat-1500 image</p>
    <p>
      no other image are expected in this configuration but we could have more
      than 3
    </p>
    <p>
      You should also pay attention to this detail: once the bigger picture is
      loaded on chrome the smaller versions won't load because there's no point
      in loading extra images when the best one is already on the client side
    </p>

    <img
      class="srcset"
      src="assets/images/cat-500.jpg"
      srcset="
        assets/images/cat-500.jpg   500w,
        assets/images/cat-1000.jpg 1000w,
        assets/images/cat-1500.jpg 1500w
      "
      alt="single source image with multiple srcset"
    />

    <p>
      smallest picture is provided in the src attribute as a fallback for older
      browsers
    </p>
    <p>
      the srcset attribute expects a comma separated list of src together with
      their matching width on the viewport
    </p>

    <p>+</p>
    <p>
      works fine in all browsers if we leave the src attribute as a fallback for
      older browsers
    </p>
    <p>
      will load an image that suits the viewport which improves performances
    </p>
    <p>suits 95% of the cases in kevin powells' opinion</p>

    <p>-</p>
    shouldn't be used if the images don't have the same aspect ratio
