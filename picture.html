      You don’t need to know all of the use cases, but you do need to know the
      difference between the two most common use cases
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolution switching — In the resolution switching use case, we need to
      select a different source of the same image because we need a different
      resolution for any number of reasons. These reasons include the image
      being used at a different size based on the size of the screen, the pixel
      density of the screen, or to avoid downloading unnecessarily large images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art direction — In the art direction use case, there is some reason why we
      need to modify the content of an image under certain conditions. Maybe we
      need to crop the image differently on small screens. Or perhaps we’re
      working with a hero image that contains text and simply providing a
      smaller version of the image won’t work because the text will be
      unreadable. Basically, if you could resize an image without making any
      other changes, and have a new source that solves your responsive images
      needs, then you’re talking about the resolution switching use case.
