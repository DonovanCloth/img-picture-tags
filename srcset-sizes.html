    <h2>
      The img tag with a source AND a srcset attribute AND sizes attribute
    </h2>

    <p>below 625px will trigger the cat-500 image because image is 80% wide</p>
    <p>
      below 1333px will trigger the cat-1000 image because image is 75% wide
    </p>
    <p>
      below 1430px will trigger the cat-1500 image because image is 70% wide
    </p>

    <img
      class="srcset-sizes"
      src="assets/images/cat-500.jpg"
      srcset="
        assets/images/cat-500.jpg   500w,
        assets/images/cat-1000.jpg 1000w,
        assets/images/cat-1500.jpg 1500w
      "

      (min-width: 750px) 75vw,

    <p>+</p>
    <p>won't load image until it reaches its srcset breakpoint FOR REAL</p>
    <p>
      together with this attribute the optimization reaches its maximum capacity
    </p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>
      doing media queries in the css and again in the sizes attribute represents
      too much work for the benefits we're looking for
    </p>
    <p>makes a small thing look ultra complex</p>
