    <h2>The img tag with a source attribute</h2>

    <p>
      In order to test it just disable the cache from your browser and refresh
      the page on different width
    </p>
    <p>
      you'll notice that the same image is loaded no matter how wide your screen
      is
    </p>

    <img src="assets/images/cat-1500.jpg" alt="single source image" />

    <p>+</p>
    <p>works fine in all browsers</p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>loads the image provided in the source attribute no matter what</p>
    <p>
      if the source image is big it will take a lot of time to load on mobile
    </p>
    <p>
      if the source image is small it will be rendered as a blurred and pixeled
      image
    </p>
    <p>
      overall not optimized to adapt to the various range of existing screens
    </p>

    <h2>
      The img tag with a source AND a srcset attribute AND sizes attribute
    </h2>

    <p>below 625px will trigger the cat-500 image because image is 80% wide</p>
    <p>
      below 1333px will trigger the cat-1000 image because image is 75% wide
    </p>
    <p>
      below 1430px will trigger the cat-1500 image because image is 70% wide
    </p>

    <img
      class="srcset-sizes"
      src="assets/images/cat-500.jpg"
      srcset="
        assets/images/cat-500.jpg   500w,
        assets/images/cat-1000.jpg 1000w,
        assets/images/cat-1500.jpg 1500w
      "
      sizes="(min-width: 1250px) 70vw,
      (min-width: 750px) 75vw,
      80vw"
      alt="single source image with multiple srcset"
    />

    <p>+</p>
    <p>won't load image until it reaches its srcset breakpoint FOR REAL</p>
    <p>
      together with this attribute the optimization reaches its maximum capacity
    </p>

    <p>-</p>
    <p>
      doing media queries in the css and again in the sizes attribute represents
      too much work for the benefits we're looking for
    </p>
    <p>makes a small thing look ultra complex</p>

    <h2>Should I use the picture tag ?</h2>

    <p>
      You don’t need to know all of the use cases, but you do need to know the
      difference between the two most common use cases
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolution switching — In the resolution switching use case, we need to
      select a different source of the same image because we need a different
      resolution for any number of reasons. These reasons include the image
      being used at a different size based on the size of the screen, the pixel
      density of the screen, or to avoid downloading unnecessarily large images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art direction — In the art direction use case, there is some reason why we
      need to modify the content of an image under certain conditions. Maybe we
      need to crop the image differently on small screens. Or perhaps we’re
      working with a hero image that contains text and simply providing a
      smaller version of the image won’t work because the text will be
      unreadable. Basically, if you could resize an image without making any
      other changes, and have a new source that solves your responsive images
      needs, then you’re talking about the resolution switching use case. If you
      need to change anything other than resolution, you’re talking about art
      direction.
